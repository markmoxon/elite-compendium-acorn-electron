# Compiled game discs for the Elite Compendium

This folder contains the double-sided DSD and ADF disc images for the Elite Compendium, as produced by the build process. This image can be loaded into an emulator like Electroniq, or into a real Acorn Electron using an SD Card.

It also contains the exact same disc image, but split into two single-sided SSD disc images, one for drive 0 and another for drive 2. These can be used in systems that do not support DSD images.

Right on, Commanders!
